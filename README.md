# Lost in Thoughts All Alone
*You are an ocean of waves  
Weaving a dream  
Like thoughts become a river stream  
Yet may the tide ever change  
Flowing like time  
To the path, yours to climb*

*Thou seek the light  
With an outstretched hand  
A divine blade lies before you  
So command the wake of dreams  
To restore the world, cut 'way the seams*

*Join in our prayer, in our song  
Of birthrights and love  
Come the sun, illuminate the sky  
Pray that we may quell the dark  
Light take the throne  
Lost in thoughts, all alone*

*You are an ocean of waves  
Weaving a dream  
Like thoughts become a river stream  
Yet may the tide ever change  
Flowing like time  
To the path yours to claim*

*Thou seek the dark  
With an unsheathed blade  
Now a white ivory throne beckons  
So obtain the fate you sow  
On this path, be weary friend and foe*

*Join in the tale, in the blight  
Of conquest and lies  
Come the sun, to tarnish in the sky  
Vow that we shall tear the light  
Dark seize the throne  
Lost in thoughts, all alone*

*May thy chosen path lead way and grace you with virtue  
But surely a balance awaits  
So be it bliss or pain you gain  
Beyond the route-way's end  
You'll gain resilience and weakness  
The trials, the thorn in your side  
Becomes the greatest strength in you*

*Descend into the abyss thou see  
Where the hearts of many wander  
Quietly, they wish and weave  
Placing hope inside their one, pure dream*

*After the storm stills its wake  
May all be blessed  
So the fate and fallen can find rest  
Your will, the water reflects  
So all will know  
Your hands brought the morrow*

*You are an ocean of waves  
Weaving a dream  
Like thoughts become a river stream  
Yet may the tide ever change  
Flowing like time  
To the path, yours to climb*

*You are an ocean of waves*
