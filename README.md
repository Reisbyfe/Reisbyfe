# Fiery Bonds
*Promises were made to you on the fields of your awakening  
Unaware that this would be the start of your story*

*Images come back to you and flicker in your memory  
You pray for strength to carry on  
I heard you calling out to me*

*So even though it may be easier to run from the fighting  
What you sought all along was the strength to free us all from this dark night of sorrow*

*You can seize your dreams  
Distant though they seem  
Like the wind that sweeps across the plains  
You can rise up and begin again*

*May your wish come true  
We can see this through  
Just show me your brightest smile  
To restore the light of morning sky*

*Promises you made to me as you gazed into my eyes of blue  
Hoping that our paths would cross once again*

*On that day when all was lost, I remember what you said to me  
That the past, our wounds, and all our pain  
Would be healed by the break of dawn*

*So long ago, you always stood beside and put your faith in me  
I was scared and alone until we forged a bond together that would last forever*

*Gather up your tears  
Put aside your fears  
Bare your heart, your fate's desires  
Reignite the dimming fires*

*If you pray with passion  
Find your way to action  
You can make your dream reality  
Be a shining star for all to see*

*So many times I was defeated and I'd given up hope  
Teach me to care when all I love is lost and gone up in smoke  
And I can't hold back these burning tears*

*Who will be the light  
In this endless night?*

*Bonds of fire connect us  
Love provides, protects us  
Feel the warmth of precious memories  
The promises you've kept to me*

*Bonds of hope unite us  
Shining on to guide us  
The story that you left behind  
Will be told until the end of time*
