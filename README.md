# Lost in Thoughts All Alone
*You are an ocean of waves
Weaving a dream
Like thoughts become a river stream
Yet may the tide ever change
Flowing like time
To the path, yours to climb*

*Thou seek the light
With an outstretched hand
A divine blade lies before you
So command the wake of dreams
To restore the world, cut 'way the seams*

*Join in our prayer, in our song
Of birthrights and love
Come the sun, illuminate the sky
Pray that we may quell the dark
Light take the throne
Lost in thoughts, all alone*

*You are an ocean of waves
Weaving a dream
Like thoughts become a river stream
Yet may the tide ever change
Flowing like time
To the path yours to claim*

*Thou seek the dark
With an unsheathed blade
Now a white ivory throne beckons
So obtain the fate you sow
On this path, be weary friend and foe*

*Join in the tale, in the blight
Of conquest and lies
Come the sun, to tarnish in the sky
Vow that we shall tear the light
Dark seize the throne
Lost in thoughts, all alone*

*May thy chosen path lead way and grace you with virtue
But surely a balance awaits
So be it bliss or pain you gain
Beyond the route-way's end
You'll gain resilience and weakness
The trials, the thorn in your side
Becomes the greatest strength in you*

*Descend into the abyss thou see
Where the hearts of many wander
Quietly, they wish and weave
Placing hope inside their one, pure dream*

*After the storm stills its wake
May all be blessed
So the fate and fallen can find rest
Your will, the water reflects
So all will know
Your hands brought the morrow*

*You are an ocean of waves
Weaving a dream
Like thoughts become a river stream
Yet may the tide ever change
Flowing like time
To the path, yours to climb*

*You are an ocean of waves*
